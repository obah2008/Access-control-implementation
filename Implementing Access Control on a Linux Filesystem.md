# Linux Filesystem Access Control (DAC)

Access control is one of the fundamental pillars of information security, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources while preventing unauthorized access. In operating systems, particularly Linux, access control mechanisms are built into the file system and are enforced through users, groups, and permissions.

This project demonstrates how Discretionary Access Control (DAC) can be implemented on a Linux system by creating users, groups, and files, then assigning permissions to enforce different levels of access. By the end of the project, we will see how Linux enforces restricti
