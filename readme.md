# Project Description

This project is designed to move beyond textbook definitions of access control and apply theoretical knowledge in a practical environment. While many can define access control and even list its types (DAC, MAC, RBAC, ABAC), far fewer have hands-on experience with implementing these models across real systems.

Through a series of mini-labs, this project demonstrates how access control methods are not only understood in theory but also enforced in practice. The first part focuses on Linux Discretionary Access Control (DAC) using users, groups, and file permissions, setting the stage for later implementations in applications (RBAC), databases (RLS), and cloud IAM policies.
